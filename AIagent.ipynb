              "<bound method BaseModel.dict of AIMessage(content='Rocket boosters, also known as solid rocket boosters or liquid rocket boosters, are used to provide additional thrust to a launch vehicle during the initial phase of flight. There are several reasons why rocket boosters are used:\\n\\n1. Increased thrust: Rocket boosters can provide a significant amount of additional thrust, which helps the launch vehicle to overcome the force of gravity and accelerate to higher speeds more quickly.\\n2. Shorter launch duration: By providing a burst of extra thrust at the beginning of the flight, rocket boosters can help to reduce the overall duration of the launch, which can be important for missions with tight timelines or for reducing the amount of time that the launch vehicle is exposed to potential hazards.\\n3. Improved payload capacity: Rocket boosters can help to increase the payload capacity of a launch vehicle by providing the additional thrust needed to lift heavier payloads into orbit.\\n4. Flexibility: Rocket boosters can be used in a variety of configurations, depending on the specific needs of the mission. For example, some launch vehicles use multiple, smaller boosters, while others use a single, larger booster.\\n5. Reusability: Some rocket boosters are designed to be reusable, which can help to reduce the cost of launching missions into space. For example, the Space Shuttle used solid rocket boosters that were recovered and refurbished after each flight.\\n\\nOverall, rocket boosters are an important tool for launching spacecraft into orbit, and they provide a number of benefits that can help to improve the performance and efficiency of launch vehicles.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 346, 'prompt_tokens': 13, 'total_tokens': 359, 'completion_time': 0.553599804, 'prompt_time': 0.002429673, 'queue_time': 0.010848767, 'total_time': 0.556029477}, 'model_name': 'mixtral-8x7b-32768', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_c5f20b5bb1', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-a0c25de3-f26d-4b7e-ac63-4ae4554440d2-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 13, 'output_tokens': 346, 'total_tokens': 359})>"
